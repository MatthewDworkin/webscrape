Data Science Minor Overlap Policies
1. Students may overlap up to 1 course in the upper division requirements for the Data Science minor with each of their majors (for example, a Computer Science major may count COMPSCI/STAT C100 toward both their major and the Data Science minor).
2. A maximum of one course offered by or cross-listed with the student’s major department(s) may count toward the data science minor upper-division requirements, including any overlapping course (for example, if a Computer Science major takes COMPSCI/STAT C100 toward the Data Science minor, this is the only COMPSCI, ELENG, or EECS course which may count toward the upper-division requirements for the minor).
